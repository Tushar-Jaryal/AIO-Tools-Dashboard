# AIOTOOLS DASHBOARD

## Description :

This is the full stack admin dashboard project I created in my post graduation. This admin dashboard helps admins to manage their team and get the related info filtered and organized. The front end is built using React, material UI, and Redux-toolkit. The backend has been built using Node, Express, and MongoDB. Dark and light mode options has been made available.

## Front End :
## How It's Made:

Tech used: React JS, Material UI, Redux-toolkit

Material UI makes styling really easy for the react front end. Redux-toolkit makes state management easy. API calls are all made at one place using redux-toolkit query.

### Optimizations

There is abutton added for Settings page. That could be implemented with admin having the choice of adding new users.

### Lessons Learned

Using Material UI to style the front end was something new and interesting for me to learn.
Using Redux-toolkit to manage state and to make API calls in one place was a new experience for me.

## Back End :
## How It's Made:

Tech used: Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB.

### Optimizations

Api for adding new users could be added.

### Lessons Learned

Inserting user data and other sales related data in bulk was a new experience for me.
